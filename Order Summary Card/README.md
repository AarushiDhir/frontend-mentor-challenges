## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although this was a fairly simple project, I learnt to implement the hover animation, which was interesting.

```css
#paymentbtn:hover{
    box-shadow: 0 0.5em 0.5em -0.4em var(--box-shadow-color);
    transform: translateY(-0.25em);
    --box-shadow-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
}
```

### Continued development

I found the part of aligning components in the 'Annual Plan' part a bit challenging. The link for 'change' is still not aligned to my satisfaction, so I would like to work on flexbox. In the next iteration of this project I also wish to use some CSS styling framework, to further enhance the project. 

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me better implement tags and components in their context on reference.
